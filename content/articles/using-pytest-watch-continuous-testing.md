Summary: Using a continuous monitoring testing tool with your Python Pytest project
Lang: en
Status: published

I started making an interesting tool called gotime. 
I'm a big fan of Test Driven Development and working with pytest.

This tool [pytest-watch](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-watch/) will continuously monitor your project and run any test that has underlying changes to your project code.
