Summary: A collection of links that I'm looking at to see if it is worthwhile to make a beehive monitoring system

So, I've been keeping bees for a few years and really want to start collecting some information about them.
I've lost my hive for the last two winters (silly reasons) and now want to gather a little bit more informatoin about the hive over time to see if there is a problem.

My initial step is to always see what other people have been doing. 

This post is a collection of links from around the web that I'm going to use as my starting point for generating a tool and backend support for collecting data from my hive.
I'm going to try to see if I can find links, the comment about the good and bad of each of these, potentially what I can implement, then what kind of work needs to be done to it to get it up and moving.
I'll finally give each item a priority then a potential action so I can build something step by step.
